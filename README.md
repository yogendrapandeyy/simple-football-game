# simple-football-game
An attempt to create basic html, css and javascript based football game.
This is a first major project i did after initially learning some css, html and javascript, and it was challenging but fun as well as football is passion for me, whatever i did here i did with lot of heart, i uses most basic of css and javascript, does not use canvas or any library, uses just basic functions and css and javascript animations, it took lot of time adn effort , it is not a professional looking thing , at has lot of basic flaws for game , i enjoyed it , it was challenging but fun, it has a football with spinning effect, some defenders who chase the ball when ball i around them and movement buttons for moving the ball.
